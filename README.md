# Live Streaming App Skeleton

This repository contains a basic project structure for a live streaming application.

- **backend** – ASP.NET Core 9 project using minimal APIs.
- **frontend** – Next.js 15 (React 19) application skeleton.

Both projects are empty templates ready for further development.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed before building the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Backend

To run the backend API locally:

```bash
cd backend

dotnet run
```

The API will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Frontend

To start the Next.js development server:

```bash
cd frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
